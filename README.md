# BiLSTM-CRF for Hallucination Span Detection

This repository contains my individual contribution to a group NLP project at TU Wien, focused on Hallucination Span Detection in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs (SemEval 2025, Task 3).

The approach is inspired by Named Entity Recognition (NER), particularly BIO-tagging, where hallucinations are treated like named entities.

For detailed implementation notes and experimental results, please see the `BiLSTM_README.md` file.
